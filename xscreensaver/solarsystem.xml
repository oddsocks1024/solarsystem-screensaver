A screensaver for Linux and UNIX that displays the planets of the Solar System
(inc Pluto). A random planet is chosen and rotated on screen against a
starfield background. As the planet orbits the sun, it transitions from light
into darkness and a corona effect appears.

Written by Ian Chapman; 2009.
