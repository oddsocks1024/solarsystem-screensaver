THE SOLARSYSTEM SCREENSAVER

1. WHAT IS IT?
A screensaver for Linux and UNIX that displays the planets of the Solar System
(inc Pluto). A random planet is chosen and rotated on screen against a
starfield background. As the planet orbits the sun, it transitions from light
into darkness and a corona effect appears.


2. HOW TO USE SOLARSYSTEM
If Solarsystem compiles and installs successfully for you, then it should be
available from the gnome-screensaver-preferences program or available in the
KDE screensaver preferences. Xscreensaver is supported, but requires manual
installation.


3. FAQ

    * Which screensaver systems are supported?
    - Officially Gnome 2, KDE 4 and XScreensaver. Others might work but have
      not been tested.

    * I can't access the configuration or setup options, why?
    - Solarsystem does not currently have support for configuring any options. This
      is very likely to be added in the future. You can however change various
      options at compile time. Please see the solarsystem.h file in the src
      directory

    * I'm running KDE or Gnome and Solarsystem compiled and installed, but I can't
      find it in the screensaver list. Any ideas?
    - Some distributions replace Gnome's or KDE's native screensaver system
      with Xscreensaver. Try following install instructions for Xscreensaver
    - You may need to specify the correct install prefix with configure.
      Solarsystem is installed in /usr/local by default if no prefix is specified,
      which may be incorrect for your operating system.

    * Why does support for Xscreensaver need to be installed manually?
    - Xscreensaver does not appear to provide a mechanism to detect where its
      screensavers and configuration files should be installed and I haven't
      found a method which works safely and reliably across all supported
      operating systems.

    * Is KDE 3 supported?
    - Not officially. Solarsystem's build system is not setup for KDE 3.
      However with some manual intervention you can probably get it working.

    * Solarsystem runs really slowly, why?
    - Solarsystem makes use of OpenGL. The most likely cause is that you don't
      have hardware accelerated 3D and therefore most of the work is being
      handled by the CPU instead of the GPU. Usually this is a misconfigured
      system, or your graphics chipset is too old.

    * Where do I send bug reports?
    - See the AUTHORS file.

    * Where do I send patches/contributions?
    - See the AUTHORS file.
